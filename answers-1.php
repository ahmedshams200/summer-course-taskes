/* In PHP, a class cannot directly inherit from more than one class, 
which means it does not support multiple inheritance for classes
but Instead of having a single class inherit from multiple classes, 
you can create separate classes and then use composition to include
 instances of those classes within the main class. */

 /*Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple
  methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter
                      ==================
     Method overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide a specific 
     implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass


     static and instance methods can be overloaded (have multiple versions with different parameters), 
     only instance methods can be overridden (provide a new implementation in a subclass).
